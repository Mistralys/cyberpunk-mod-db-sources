# Cyberpunk Mod DB sources

Source files for the [Cyberpunk clothing mod DB][] for authoring 
specific parts of the database.

This is a separate package to keep the size of the main mod smaller. 
It contains files that are only required to author and maintain the 
database, and are not needed for the mod to function.
